<h4>Letter to Dhwani</h4><br><br>
<p>I am really sorry but my parents(mother) knows about our relationship. She is not raising this conversation but i know that she knows about this. And my family also <b>don't understand the Jain Cast,</b> I tried to explain her nut she is not understanding. I tried my best. I told them that <b>I really Love You</b> can't live without you but they said that this is not the correct age for me to fall in love, but still my heart says that leave this talks right not the time we take to Grow up they will adjust with our thoughts and with what we like so i would only thell that I Love you and will always till you does me  And i want you to promise me that no matters what happens but you will always love me. I love You but please never betray me and my Love.You will always be mine, To me you are the best thing i have ever got in my life. Without you i can't live. I will anyway convince my family but you will always love me, never betray me and always be with me. ONE more thing that i lied to everyone that i don't love you from 17th May but love you from the begning. From the begning only you were everything to me. You were even my Parent too. But never told you because i thought you would misunderstand me or would not believe me. If you are with me then I can do anything in my life. You told me to hid it from my family I hid it but just can't save the letter from my mother so please forgive me. I would never do such thing that hurts you but please never to stop loving me. And never break our relationship, PLEASE!! PLEASE!!.I just can't live without you. Ilove you Ilove you and will do so till the last breadth of my life.</p>
